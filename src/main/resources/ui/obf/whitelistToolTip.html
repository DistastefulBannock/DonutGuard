The whitelist is an easy-to-use setting that overrides<br/>
specific classes and resources from the blacklist.<br/>
<br/>
Because both the DonutGuard black and white lists use regex, <br/>
you may find that this setting is of lesser significance<br/>
in comparison to other bytecode obfuscators.
<br/>
<br/>
The strings added to this list are compared to the paths<br/>
of different entries in the jar. This means that it uses<br/>
forward slashes(/) rather than dots(.) and includes file <br/>
extensions.

Clicking this button will open a regex helper site for<br/>
your use.
