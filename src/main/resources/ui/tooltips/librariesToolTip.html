Any jar or zip files added to this list are loaded into <br/>
the obfuscator after the input jar. If enabled, the classes <br/>
loaded here will be used by the ASM ClassWriter to compute <br/>
frames. You can also set DonutGuard to write the libraries'<br/>
classes into the output jar.
<br/>
<br/>
Classes and resources loaded from libraries are never <br/>
run through mutators.
