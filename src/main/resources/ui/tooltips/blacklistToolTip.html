The blacklist is an easy-to-use setting that blocks out<br/>
specific classes and resources from reaching the mutators.<br/>
<br/>
The blacklist in DonutGuard uses regular expressions so<br/>
the developer has more power and control.
<br/>
<br/>
The strings added to this list are compared to the paths<br/>
of different entries in the jar. This means that it uses<br/>
forward slashes(/) rather than dots(.) and includes file <br/>
extensions.

Clicking this button will open a regex helper site for<br/>
your use.
