### Guidelines
 - Please make sure to document your code. This includes javadocs and comments.
    - Comments should explain why rather than what.
    - All abstract methods should have javadocs. They are not required but preferred on regular methods.
 - Avoid static and wildcard imports.
 - Avoid drag-n-drop UI builders for new views or windows.
 - Indentation format is four space characters.
 - Avoid using more than three levels of indentation in your methods.
